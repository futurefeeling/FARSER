FARSER - 我的私人订制APP
================

FARSER APP powered by React Native
FARSER APP 由 React Native 强力驱动

## Running Environment(mac)
1. install `brew`, go to brew [homepage](http://brew.sh/) to down it.
2. install `node`.
 - if you had installed the brew, run `brew install node`
 - but I really recommend installing the [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation), and then run `nvm install node && nvm alias default node`. To do these, you had installed node.
3. Moreover, if you in China, I suggested you had better to install the `npm registry manager`. Run `npm install -g nrm` and `nrm use taobao` to exchange to the taobao registry. About nrm, more info in [here](https://github.com/Pana/nrm).

## Special dependence
- [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons), so you had better to config it with its docs.And if you are in mac, do as following:
    - `sudo npm install rnpm -g`
    - `rnpm link`

## Run App
1. `git clone https://github.com/futurefeeling/FARSER.git`
2. `cd FARSER && npm install`
3. `npm start`
